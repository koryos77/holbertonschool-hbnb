# Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive technical blueprint for the HBnB (Holberton BnB) project, an Airbnb-inspired web application. It outlines
the system's architecture, design, and key interactions to guide the implementation process. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear
reference for developers, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the project's development phases.

## High-Level Architecture

The three-layer architecture promotes separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. The facade pattern simplifies the interface
between layers, reducing coupling and improving system flexibility.

## Business Logic Layer

The class diagram illustrates the relationships between core entities. The inheritance from a base model ensures consistent handling of common
attributes across all entities.

## API Interaction Flow

The sequence diagrams demonstrate how user requests are processed through the system, from the initial API call to data persistence and response
generation. These diagrams are crucial for understanding the system's behavior and identifying potential optimization points.
